 #- Hello!  Welcome to [i][b]De[/b]spoil[/i] - The (hopefully) less spoilery Sandman Universe timeline.[br][br]Click any issue title to expand it, or in the menu on the right, expand the [b]'I have read...'[/b] section, and you can tick which collections (books), story threads (arcs) or individual issues of The Sandman (and other spin-offs within The Sandman Universe) that you have read.  You can then choose to see these events in order of publication (the default) or in chronological order.  You can also highlight any event containing a particular character / item / place using the [b]'Highlight'[/b] section, or by clicking any highlighted names within the text, which should help with those [i]"where did I see that character before?"[/i] moments.[br][br]Note that this doesn't take the Audible adaptation or Netflix show into account (yet), but making this friendly to those audiences is high on the todo list![br][br]The intention is, you shouldn't get accidentally spoiled by seeing anything from issues you haven't read, so if you really are a new reader, don't click more than you need to.[br][br]Have fun, and let me know if you have any problems - you can contact me or make a contribution via any of the links at the bottom of the menu.
